forked from: https://github.com/riyaz942/web-portfolio

Used Created-React-App for this project so to run locally
- clone repository
- Install NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/download/

“npm start” won’t work because the NodeJS versions >17 are incompatible with the code written for this site. (explanation) So instead:

- Install nvm (https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
- Run `nvm install 16.13.0`
- Run `nvm use 16.13.0`
- Run `npm start` to initialize local host.
